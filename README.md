# Student-Performance-Prediction-DFA24

# Preamble

An important general concern all over the African continent has been the sub-par quality of elementary and secondary education which has been further highlighted by the recent push to Computer-Based tests for students in ultimate classes (especially SSS3). In fairness, there has been some action taken by CSOs, governments and other bodies to improve the quality of education, and by extension, students’ performance. 

Recent statistics from JAMB (a Nigerian pre-tertiary examination governing body) shows that 76% (approx. 4 out of 5) of students who participated in the 2024 UTME scored less than 200 (50%). This interesting insight emphasizes the need to find proactive solutions to this problem. 


# Project Overview

This project aimed to address the issue of underperformance in secondary school exams across Africa, particularly focusing on JAMB and WASSCE exams. A data-driven solution was developed to predict and improve student outcomes by building a comprehensive data collection, warehousing, and analysis pipeline.

# Objectives
Data Collection: Designed a data collection method simulating student bio-data, academic history, parental background, study habits, and resource access.
Data Infrastructure: Created a data warehouse to store academic performance, attendance, resource allocation, and extracurricular activities for the entire school.
Predictive Modeling: Developed models to predict students' likelihood of passing upcoming exams, considering factors beyond academic scores.
Stakeholder Recommendations: Provided actionable recommendations to improve student performance based on data insights.
# Project Scope
Data Collection: Generated synthetic data reflecting the African secondary school environment, including socio-economic and academic factors.
Data Structuring: Designed a data warehouse schema to store student records, parental background, exam results, attendance, and resource data efficiently.
Data Analysis: Performed exploratory data analysis to identify key factors influencing student success.
Model Development: Built predictive models, using logistic regression and random forests, to forecast student performance. SMOTE was applied to handle class imbalance.
Reporting and Visualization: Created visual dashboards and reports to communicate insights to stakeholders.
# Key Deliverables
Data Collection Plan: Outlined methods and tools for generating and collecting data relevant to student performance.
Data Warehouse Dictionary: Provided the design schema, table relationships, and data types used to store school-wide information.
Analytical Models: Developed predictive models to identify at-risk students and factors contributing to exam outcomes.
Final Solution: Delivered a reporting system and actionable recommendations to school administrators to enhance student performance.
# Recommendations
Implement targeted tutoring for students identified as at-risk by the model.
Engage parents, especially those with lower education levels, in their children’s academic progress.
Improve resource access, particularly internet connectivity and study materials, to underprivileged students.
